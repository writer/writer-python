    Defines the maximum number of tokens (words and characters) that the model can
    generate in the response. The default value is set to 16, but it can be adjusted
    to allow for longer or shorter responses as needed.

    tools: Iterable[Tool]
    """
    [Beta] An array of tools described to the model using JSON schema that the model
    can use to generate responses. Please note that tool calling is in beta and
    subject to change. Passing graph IDs will automatically use the Knowledge Graph
    tool.

    """
    Sets the threshold for "nucleus sampling," a technique to focus the model's
    token generation on the most likely subset of tokens. Only tokens with
    cumulative probability above this threshold are considered, controlling the
    trade-off between creativity and coherence.
